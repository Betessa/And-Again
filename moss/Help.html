<h2>What does MOSS do?</h2>
<p>Moss (for a Measure Of Software Similarity) is an automatic system for determining the similarity of programs. To date, the main application of Moss has been in detecting plagiarism in programming classes. Since its development in 1994, Moss has been very effective in this role. The algorithm behind moss is a significant improvement over other cheating detection algorithms.</p>
<h2>What does it not do?</h2>
<p>Moss can not be used totally by itself to check the plaigarism of code. Simple programs might have a high similarity between submission because there is only one way to do what was asked. Thus after MOSS has done it's part, please look over the results before making any decisions about the students' work.</p>    
<h2>How does the graph work?</h2>
<p>The nodes are students and the edges represent code similarity. Clicking on an edge will take you to the MOSS report for the nodes it connects.There are also a few handy options to customize what you see on the graph. Checking thickness will scale the thickness of edges in the graph according to the similarity of the nodes it connects, this makes it easy to spot very problematic students. Clusters will show different clusters, disconnected parts of the graph, in different colours. Articulation points will show you the articulation points of the graph with a triangle, this might indicate a student who received code from one set of students and spread it to another group, once again look at the code reports before assuming that this is what happened. Student number or name toggles wether you see the nodes as student numbers or names. Lastly, we will not show you similarity of anything less than the number indicted in the threshold (this number is percentage of code).  </p>
